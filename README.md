GagBook
=======

GagBook is an unofficial mobile app for [9GAG](http://9gag.com) website, currently available
for SailfishOS, MeeGo Harmattan and Symbian^3.

GagBook get data from 9GAG by scraping their website, or using [InfiniGAG](https://github.com/k3min/infinigag)
API. This might be unethical but I made this app because there is no official 9GAG app for MeeGo Harmattan
and Symbian^3.
